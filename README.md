## Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

## Setup

1. Install the required packages using requirements.txt:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Follow the instructions at Google Calendar Simple API [Getting Started](https://google-calendar-simple-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) to set up the Google Calendar API credentials. Copy the credentials to `~/.credentials`

3. Set up an email account for your bot which you will use to email to and the bot will monitor. I used Gmail and got an [app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

4. Set up a [serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) account to provide Search.

## Environment Variables

To set up environment variables for the project, rename the `sample_env` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary information. Here's a description of each variable:

* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for the GPT-4 model.
* `SERPER_API_KEY`: Your [serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) API key for search functionality.
* `EMAIL_USER`: The email address of your bot.
* `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: The API key or password for your bot's email account.
* `EXPECTED_SENDERS`: A comma-separated list of email addresses that are allowed to send commands to the bot.
* `CALENDAR_USER`: The google calendar user.
* `CALENDAR_TOKEN_PICKLE`: File location of token pickle from Google Calendar install above.

Example:

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_key
SCRAPINGANT_API_KEY=your_scrapingant_key (optional)
EMAIL_USER=your_bot_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_bot_email_password
EXPECTED_SENDERS=user1@example.com,user2@example.com
CALENDAR_USER=user@gmail.com
CALENDAR_TOKEN_PATH=/home/user/.credentials/token.pickle
```

## Running
Run the email assistant which runs in a loop - I just ran mine in `screen` and detach it:

``` bash
python code/main.py
```

To test on console run with `--testconsole` argument:

``` bash
python code/main.py --testconsole
```
